This distribution of UCODE_2014 includes three programs often used with UCODE

OPR-PPR calculates measures of data importance to model predictions. 
The quantities evaluated are observations (targets) and parameters from model development.
Thus, OPR-PPR provides statistics that quantify the link between observations and predictions (the statistic 
is called OPR) and the link between parameters and predictions (the statistic is called PPR).

MMA supports the use of multiple alternative models. The models may differ in the included processes, 
parameterization methods, and in other ways. All models need to be evaluated using the same set of observations.

SIM_Adjust allows the user to manage circumstances in which the simulated equivalent for one or mode observations 
is not produced. The user can define an alternate simulated value or constant to be used instead.
