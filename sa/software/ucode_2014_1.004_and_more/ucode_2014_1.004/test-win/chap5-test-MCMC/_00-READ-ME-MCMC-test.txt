Directory "chap5-test-MCMC"

This directory contains files for UCODE MCMC runs described in Appendix D 
of the UCODE_2014 manual. Parallel processing is demonstrated on one computer
by using multiple folders for the runs.

The batch files should be execuated sequentially in the order presented
below, and should NOT be executed simulataneously as they will interfere
with one another

The batch file
_00-clean-HO1-HO2.bat cleans and removes the runner directories

The batch files in the "HO1\HOmodel_test1" directory do the tasks described 
below using files in the subdirectories HOmodel_forward and HOmodel_prediction

00-a-clean.bat - cleans the ucode output files after the run has been completed

00-a-Run-calibration.bat - conducts and optimization run in the HOmodel_test1 
directory which produces the HO1._* files needed for the subsequent MCMC runs

00-a-Run-forward.bat conducts a forward forward simulation for the parameter 
samples listed in the parameter_data input block

01-runners-populate.bat - sets up the runner directories to emulate parallel
processing on a single computer

02-start-runners.bat - starts the runners

03-RunMCMC-forward.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC to generate parameter samples

04-RunMCMC-prediction.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC_PREDICTION to evaluate 
predictions for generated parameter samples

05-start-runners.bat - starts the runners again because they terminate after
runnning 03-RunMCMC-forward.bat

06-RunMCMC-forward&prediction.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC to generate parameter 
samples, then runs UCODE MCMC_PREDICTION to evaluate predictions for 
generated parameter samples (this does the task of both 03 and 04.

The files in the "HO1\Plot4GWchart-100000 model runs" directory are  these are 
the data sets generated by MCMC used to create figures in appendix D of the 
UCODE_2014 manual. 


The following batch files in the "HO2\HOmodel_test2" directory  

00-a-clean.bat - cleans the ucode output files after the run has been completed

It is assumed the runners have been started by batch files 01 and 02 
in the "HO1\HOmodel_test1" directory

01-RunMCMC-forward.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC to generate parameter samples

02-RunMCMC-prediction.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC_PREDICTION to evaluate 
predictions for generated parameter samples

03-RunMCMC-forward&prediction.bat - Runs UCODE MCMC to generate parameter 
samples, then runs UCODE MCMC_PREDICTION to evaluate predictions for 
generated parameter samples (this does the task of both 01 and 02).
