<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">New users
requested a&nbsp;simple example.<br>
All files are included in one directory.&nbsp;<br>
All input is in ucode_dupuit.in.&nbsp;<br>
The process model is dupuit.exe which is&nbsp;presented&nbsp;in </font><font

boundary, fixed head<br>

</font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2"><b>The&nbsp;batch
file ucode_dupuit.bat executes parameter estimation<br>
&nbsp; followed by residual analysis and advanced residual analysis.<br>
The regression is performed on a simple analytical model that is &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; executed via dupuit.bat.&nbsp;<br>
The source and executable for the &nbsp;<br>
&nbsp; dupuit code are in the sub-folder code_dupuit<br>
The process-model input file is generated from&nbsp;dupuit.in.tpl</b><br>
<br>
Ucode_dupuit.in directs ucode to substitute parameter values in<br>
dupuit.in.tpl, execute dupuit.bat&nbsp;which runs the dupuit code in
the <br>
code_dupuit folder and generates output dupuit.out in the folder<br>
simple-example.1, then based on the instructions in ucode_dupuit.ins<br>
ucode extracts the results of the simulation from dupuit.out and uses<br>
those values to calculate residuals and sensitivities, ucode <br>
iteratively uses residuals and sensitivities to update the parameters <br>
and repeats until the parameters change less than tolpar. If ucode is <br>
successful, default residual analyses are executed from <br>
ucode_dupuit.bat <br>
<br>
<b>The observation data provided include a small amount of noise. <br>
Values below are in meters and days</b><br>
The true heads and flow at the left and right boundary are as follows:<br>
<b>precise analytically calculated heads from left to right at<br>
&nbsp; 5m, 15m, 25m, 35m, 45m are:</b><br>
&nbsp; 5.50475 5.89724 5.81146 5.22393 3.91489<br>
<b>with noise as entered for observations in the regression they are:</b><br>
&nbsp; 5.505 5.897 5.812 5.223 3.915<br>
<b>flow at the left boundary</b> is:<br>
&nbsp; -0.00498<br>
<b>with noise as entered in the regression:</b><br>
&nbsp; -0.0050<br>
<b>flow at the right boundary</b> is:<br>
&nbsp; 0.00872<br>
<b>with noise as entered in the regression:</b><br>
&nbsp; 0.0088<br>
<br>
New users may wish to experiment with alternative observations which <br>
can be generated by running the forward model with altered input in <br>
dupuit.in and getting the results from dupuit.out.<br>
<br>
New users may also experiment with estimating other parameters, such as
<br>
the heads at the boundaries in various combinations with K and w.<br>
<br>
One might also experiment with various settings in the ucode input.<br>
<br>
Notice that if the flow is not included as an onservation in the <br>
regression then only the ratio of K and W can be estimated, not <br>
their absolute values because the parameters are completely correlated <br>
when only heads are used as observations.</font>
