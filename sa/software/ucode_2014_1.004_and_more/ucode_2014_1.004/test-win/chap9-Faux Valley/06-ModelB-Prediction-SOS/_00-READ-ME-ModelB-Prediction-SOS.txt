Directory "06-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction-SOS"

This directory contains files for a UCODE sum-of-squares (SOS) 
surface run of Model B. This model is described in Chapter 9 of
the UCODE_2014 documentation.

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction-SOS.bat conducts a run to calculate the 
predicted values at all sets of parameter values listed in file 
01-ModelB-Prediction-SOS_ucode_sosfile.in.

For this run, we are interested in the prediction values at the sets of parameter
values, not in the SOSWR values that are the main output of the SOS run. These prediction
values are obtained from the UCODE SOS run by setting VERBOSE=5 in the ucode main
input file. Doing so will cause the extracted prediction values for each of the
parameter sets to be listed in the main ucode output file. In this directory, 
all of these prediction values have been assembled into the file
"ModelB-pred-SOS_ucode_out.extract-predvalues", using a text editor. These values
are used to construct Figures 26d-f in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.

(Note that the SOSWR values in the ._sos file for this run are not meaningful
because meaningless values of ObsValue are entered for the predictions in the main ucode
input file.)
