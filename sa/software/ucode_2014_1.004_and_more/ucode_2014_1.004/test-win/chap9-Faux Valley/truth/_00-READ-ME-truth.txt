Directory "truth"

This directory contains subdirectories with MODFLOW files for 
the true Faux Valley system representation and parameter values.
This system is discussed in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.

Subdirectory "Calibration conditions (no pumping)" contains MODFLOW
files for simulating steady-state flow with no pumping.
_00-RunModflow-tc1.bat runs the simulation.

Subdirectory "Prediction conditions (with pumping)" contains MODFLOW
files for simulating steady-state flow with pumping at the proposed
production well. Files that differ from the calibration conditions
have the prefix tc1-preds, or tc1-TRUTH-preds.
_00-RunModflow-tc1-preds.bat runs the simulation.
