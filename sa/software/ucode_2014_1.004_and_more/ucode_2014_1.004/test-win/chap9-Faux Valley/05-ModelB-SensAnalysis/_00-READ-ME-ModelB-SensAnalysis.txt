Directory "05-ModelB-SensAnalysis"

This directory contains files for a UCODE sensitivity run of Model B.
This model is described in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-SA-AllActive-NoPrior conducts a post-calibration 
sensitivity run for Model B, with the optimal estimates from the
Model B calibration, with no prior, and with all parameters activated. 
Output from this run is used to plot the composite scaled sensitivities
(CSS) in Figure 25b and the parameter correlation coefficients (PCC)
in Figure 25c.
