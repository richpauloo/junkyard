Directory "07-ModelB-opr-add"

This directory contains files for two runs of the program OPR-PPR with 
mode equal to OPRADD. In one run, potential new observations are considered
individually. In the other, groups of potential new observations are
considered. The directory also includes batch files for UCODE runs required
prior to executing OPR-PPR with mode OPRADD.

The necessary output files from several UCODE runs need to be generated and
then copied into this directory before running the program OPR-PPR. The following 
batch files accomplish this:

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-SA-AllActive-WithPrior.bat
_02-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction.bat
_03-RunUcode_ModelB-PotentialNewObs-SA.bat 

Run these batch files in sequence. The _01 and _02 batch files run UCODE in
the directory "02-ModelB-Prediction" under "chap9-FauxValley", and the
_03 batch file runs UCODE in the directory "ModelB-PotentialNewObs"
under the current directory. 
See the READ-ME files in directories "02-ModelB-Prediction" and
"ModelB-PotentialNewObs" for information about these UCODE runs.

Then, execute the following two batch files that each run OPR-PPR: 

_04-RunOPR-PPR_OprAdd-IndividualObs.bat
_05-RunOPR-PPR_OprAdd-ObsGroups.bat

Results in the ._OPR files from these two runs are plotted in Figure 27 of
the UCODE_2014 documentation.
