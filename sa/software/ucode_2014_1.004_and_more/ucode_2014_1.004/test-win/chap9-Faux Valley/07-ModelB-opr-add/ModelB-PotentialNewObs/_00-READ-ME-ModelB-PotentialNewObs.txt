Directory "ModelB-PotentialNewObs"

This directory contains files for a UCODE sensitivity analysis
run of Model B with potential new observations defined. 

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-PotentialNewObs-SA.bat conducts a sensitivity analysis
run for the two potential new observations. The MODFLOW model 
with prefix modB-potential simulates the conditions under which these
new observations will be collected. This model is described in Chapter
9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation in the section "Using the 
Model to Evaluate Potential New Data Collection".

This run generates the sensitivities for the potential observations,
which are needed as input to the program OPR-PPR for mode=OPRADD.
