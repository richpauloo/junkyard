Directory "08-ModelB-ppr"

This directory contains files for a PPR run of the program OPR-PPR.

The necessary output files from two ucode runs need to be generated and
then copied into this directory before running the program OPR-PPR.
The following batch files accomplish this:

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-SA-AllActive-WithPrior.bat
_02-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction.bat

Run these batch files in sequence, then execute the following batch file
that runs the PPR mode of OPR-PPR: 

_03-RunOPR-PPR_ppr.bat

Results in the ._PPR files from this run are plotted in Figure 28 of
the UCODE_2014 documentation.
