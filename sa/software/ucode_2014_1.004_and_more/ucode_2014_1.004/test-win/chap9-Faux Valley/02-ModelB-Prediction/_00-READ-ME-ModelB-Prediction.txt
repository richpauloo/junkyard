Directory "05-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction"

This directory contains files for UCODE sensitivity analysis, 
prediction, and prediction uncertainty runs for Model B. 
This model is described in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.

_01-RunUcode_ModelB-SA-AllActive-WithPrior.bat conducts a sensitivity
analysis run with parameters equal to their estimated values and
with all parameters activated and and all parameters having prior
information. These are the conditions needed for generating the parameter
variance covariance matrix that is used in the calculation of 
prediction uncertainty.	Parameter confidence intervals produced by
this run are plotted in Figure 26a and 26b of the UCODE_2014
documentation.

_02-RunUcode_ModelB-Prediction.bat conducts a prediction sensitivity
run for Model B, using the MODFLOW model with prediction conditions
(pumping of 2.2 m^3/s at the proposed production well). This
MODFLOW model has prefix modB-pred. Prediction scaled sensitivities
from this run are plotted in Figure 26c.

_03-RunLinUncertainty_ModelB.bat conducts a run of the program
Linear_Uncertainty, which calculates the confidence intervals
on predictions. These confidence intervals are plotted in Figure 22.
