Directory "chap9-Faux Valley"

This directory contains subdirectories with 
files for conducting (i) UCODE sensitivity analysis, prediction,
and sum-of-squares runs, and (ii) OPR-PPR runs using models that
represent the synthetic Faux Valley groundwater flow system.
This system, the MODFLOW models, and the UCODE and OPR-PPR runs
are discussed in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.

This directory also contains subdirectory "truth", which includes
the MODFLOW files for the true Faux Valley system (true system
representation and true parameter values). The true system is
known for this synthetic test case.

See the READ-ME file under each subdirectory for a description of
the runs in that subdirectory.

NOTE: Faux Valley simulations for Model B initial forward model run, 
initial sensitivity analysis, and Model B calibration using process-model 
parameters (PMP) and with SVD are in the Chap4-SVD-test directory.
