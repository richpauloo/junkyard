Directory "chap4-test-SVD"

This directory contains files for UCODE forward, sensitivity, and calibration
runs of Model B. This model is described in Chapter 9 of the UCODE_2014 documentation.
The files are located within the chap4-test-SVD directory because two of the 
three calibration runs demonstrate use of the SVD method.

The batch files should be run SEQUENTIALLY not SIMULTANEOUSLY to avoid
interference of the runs with one another

_01-RunUcode_Forward.bat conducts a forward MODFLOW run at the starting
parameter values for Model B.

_02-RunUcode_SA.bat conducts a sensitivity analysis run at the starting
parameter values. Results of this run are plotted in Table D-3.

_03-RunUcode_Regression-PMP.bat (PMP is "process-model parameter") conducts
a parameter estimation run for Model B without using SVD methods. Results
of this run are discussed in Chapter 9 and Appendix D, and presented in
Tables 7, 8, 9, D-2, and D-3 and in Figures 21 and 24a.

_04-RunUcode_Regression-SVDupdate=SVDall.bat conducts a parameter
estimation run for Model B using SDV with the SVDupdate method specified
to be SVDall (the default value). Results of this run are discussed in
Appendix D and presented in Tables D-2 and D-3.

_05-RunUcode_Regression-SVDupdate=Option2.bat conducts a parameter
estimation run for Model B using SDV with the SVDupdate method specified
to be Option2_css_pcc. Results of this run are discussed in Appendix D
and presented in Tables D-2 and D-3.

_06-RunResidAnalysis.bat conducts a run of Residual_Analysis.exe
to calculate Cook's D and DFBETAS. Results of this run are presented in 
Table 9 and Figure 24b.
