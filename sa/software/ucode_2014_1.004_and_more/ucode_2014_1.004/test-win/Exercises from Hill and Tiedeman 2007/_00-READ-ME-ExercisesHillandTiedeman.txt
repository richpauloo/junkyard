Directory "Exercises from Hill and Tiedeman 2007"

This directory contains files for conducting UCODE forward,
sensitivity analysis, and parameter estimation runs, and a
residual analysis run, for selected exercises of the
textbook "Effective Groundwater Model Calibration"
by Mary C. Hill and Claire R. Tiedeman (Wiley, 2007). The MODFLOW
model used for the exercises is described on p. 21-25 of Hill and Tiedeman.

_01-Forward-ex3.3_RunUcode.bat performs a UCODE forward run
with the starting parameter values. This is the run of 
exercise 3.3 on p. 40 of Hill and Tiedeman.

_02-Sensitivity-ex4.2_RunUcode.bat performs a UCODE sensitivity
analysis run with the starting parameter values. This is the run
of exercise 4.1 on p. 60 of Hill and Tiedeman.

_03-Regression-ex5.2_RunUcode.bat performs a UCODE regression 
run to estimate the optimal parameter values. This is the run 
of exercise 5.2c on p. 90 of Hill and Tiedeman.

_04-Analysis-ex6.2e-residual_analysis.bat performs a 
Residual_Analysis.exe run to (i) produce data for making graphs of 
independent and correlated random numbers, and (ii) compute
Cook's D and DFBETAS for the calibrated model. Exercise 6.2e on
p. 119 of Hill and Tiedeman uses the output from (i).
Exercise 7.1c on p. 146 uses the output from (ii).  

This directory also contains the ModelMuse file for the flow model,
ex3.3.gpt. ModelMuse can be downloaded from:
