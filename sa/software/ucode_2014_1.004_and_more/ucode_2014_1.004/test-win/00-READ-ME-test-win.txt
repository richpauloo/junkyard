Directories:  "chap*" have names that identify the chapter in the UCODE_2014
documentation for which the exercise provides an example. The directory
name also includes an indication of the type of problem considered.

Directory: "concatenate_intconfpred" contains an excel spreadsheet that
explains the types of errors that can occur when using the 
concatenate_intconfpred.exe code to join nonlinear uncertainty output files.

Directory: "convert_pest_prior_info" provides a simple example of how
convert_pest_prior_info.exe converts prior information from pest input
for use in ucode via the Linear_Prior_Information input block.

Directory: "Exercises from Hill and Tiedeman 2007" 
This directory includes the files for the main set of exercises in
the textbook Hill and Tiedeman, 2007, Effective groundwater model 
calibration, with analysis of data, sensitivities, predictions, and 
uncertainties: Wiley. These files are provided here so users 
of UCODE_2014 have an example that only uses the capabilities documented 
in the UCODE_2005 documentation. The files from the UCODE_2005 distribution
can be used for the same purpose.

Directory: "simple-example" provides a simple application of ucode

Directory: "ucode_2005_examples_run_with_ucode_2014" includes two of the
examples distribued with UCODE_2005, but executed with UCODE_2014
These examples are described in the UCODE_2005 manual which is included
in the doc directory
  ex1a (supporting files are in ex1a-files and in ..\test-data-win)
  ex1b (supporting files are in ex1b-files and in ..\test-data-win)
