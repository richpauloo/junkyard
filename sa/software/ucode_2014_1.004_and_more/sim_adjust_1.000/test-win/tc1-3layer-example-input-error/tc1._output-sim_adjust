      WAS EVALUATED FOR ITEMS OMITTED, OR ASSIGNED A DEFAULT VALUE,
      BY THE PROCESS MODEL
 
  Default for obs2.2 not found in input-sim_adjust
    see line            8
  Default for obs3.12d1 not found in input-sim_adjust
    see line           30

   Sequence of defaults may be incorrect, so global default is used
   Errors stem from items on the following input-sim_adjust line #s
          13  name of first item in the sequence:  obs3.1

   Defaults may be needed for following input-sim_adjust line #s
     because the GLOBAL DEFAULT was used
           8  name of first item in the sequence:  obs2.1
          30  name of first item in the sequence:  obs3.1d1

         2 OBSERVATIONS WERE ASSIGNED THE GLOBAL DEFAULT VALUE, -1.0000000E-50
