Change will not come if we wait for some other person or some other time. We are the ones we've been waiting for. We are the change that we seek. - Barak Obama
"When  you do things from your soul, you feel a river\nmoving in you, a joy.\n      \n      When actions come from another section, the feeling\n      disappears.  Don't let\n      \n      others lead you.  They may be blind or, worse, vultures.\n      Reach for the rope\n      \n      of God.  And what is that?  Putting aside self-will.\n      Because of willfulness\n      \n      people sit in jail, the trapped bird's wings are tied,\n      fish sizzle in the skillet.\n      \n      The anger of police is willfulness.  You've seen a magistrate\n      inflict visible punishment.  Now \n      \n      see the invisible.  If you could leave your selfishness, you\n      would see how you've\n      \n      been torturing your soul.  We are born and live inside black water in a well.\n      \n      How could we know what an open field of sunlight is? Don't\n      insist on going where\n      \n      you think you want to go.  Ask the way to the spring.  Your\n      living pieces will form\n      \n      a harmony.  There is a moving palace that floats in the air\n      with balconies and clear\n      \n      water flowing through, infinity everywhere, yet contained\n      under a single tent."
