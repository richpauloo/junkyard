"Infuse your life with action. 
Don't wait for it to happen. 
Make it happen. 
Make your own future. 
Make your own hope. 
Make your own love. 
And whatever your beliefs, 
honor your creator,
not by passively waiting for grace 
to come down from upon high, 
but by doing what you can to make grace happen... 
yourself, 
right now, 
right down here on Earth.
 
- Barak Obama"
"Attitude and enthusiasm play a 
big part in my life. I get excited

I also believe in laughing and 
having a good time.

"Success isn't always about greatness. 
It's about consistency. 
Consistent hard work leads to success. 
Greatness will come.

"I'm always asked, 'What's the secret to success?' 
But there are no secrets. 
Be humble. 
Be hungry. 
And always be the hardest worker in the room.

fish and a pet lizard and 
Venus flytraps. 
I have a whole ecosystem in my room, 
like a running waterfall and different 
lights and sensors set on digital timers.
